# tacKillCalculator

Basic CLI utility to take an MTF mech file and calculate how likely it is to die when a TAC is rolled for both basic rules (TACs hit the CT only) and floating crits (location of TAC is rerolled).  Does not support Tripods/Superheavies (if file parses no guarantees results are correct).  Does not account for explosive equipment like gauss or improved heavy lasers.
